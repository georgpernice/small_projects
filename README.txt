Here should small projects be placed. Each project should have its own folder, but there is a special folder with unsorted code.
There is no guarantee that the projects are right. It is just meant as a demonstration and a grasp of what i have been doing the past years, not regarding the code for my bachelor thesis the code of which I am not allowed to publish afaik.

A lot of the projects is falsely labeled and contains far less than expected but feel free to roam around and look for what you find interest in.
