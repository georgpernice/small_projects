"""Exercise 2.6: Mysterious Spikes The results shown in Figure 2.3 should be quite reliable
because they are averages over 2000 individual, randomly chosen 10-armed bandit tasks.
Why, then, are there oscillations and spikes in the early part of the curve for the optimistic
method? In other words, what might make this method perform particularly better or
worse, on average, on particular early steps? â‡¤
Exercise 2.7: Unbiased Constant-Step-Size Trick In most of this chapter we have used
sample averages to estimate action values because sample averages do not produce the
initial bias that constant step sizes do (see the analysis leading to (2.6)). However, sample
averages are not a completely satisfactory solution because they may perform poorly
on nonstationary problems. Is it possible to avoid the bias of constant step sizes while
retaining their advantages on nonstationary problems? One way is to use a step size of
